<p class="page description">The purpose of this website is to simply have a place where the 
musicians don't have to root through their stuff to find music...</p>

	<h2>
		<p>Because it's so hard for me to have to look around, I personally wanted a place for me to
go and be able to find music that I needed to play, without the hassle of searching for it.</p>
