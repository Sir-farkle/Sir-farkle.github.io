		<p>It soon became a hassle for me as a musician to look through the internet and the multiple books 
that I used to find songsthat I would only get to play maybe once or twice in the span of what could be more than two or three
months. Long story short, I compiled every song I've ever had to look up and saved them for use later Like an inventory of sorts.</p>
